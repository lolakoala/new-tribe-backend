#Tribe Backend

This is a new iteration of a [previous project](https://github.com/lolakoala/mod3-personal-project). This is the repo for the backend, which I am writing in Node.js, Express.js, and Knex.js.
You can visit the [linked repo](https://github.com/lolakoala/mod3-personal-project) for a description of the project as a whole. 

You can see the beginning of my schema in [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o-aZ8cuLeTIvUYrTdMjtii2y5ew4xqXy4aPC5NG7F3s/edit?usp=sharing).
